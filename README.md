# LinearRegression-Project
PREDICT THE HEART DISEASE FOR ORGANISATION W.H.O.[WORLD HEALTH ORGANISATION],USING MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHM RATE OF HEART ATTACK DISEASE WILL INCREASING OR DECREASING MANNER.
W.H.O["WORLD HEALTH ORGANISATION"]ESTIMATED 12million THEIR RECORDS.ONE OF THEM HALF OF THEIR RESULT IS FOUND IN U.S.THE RESEARCH INTENDERS/SCHOLAR POINT OUT THE MOST RELEVANT RISK FACTOR OF HEART ATTACK. AS A DATA SCIENCE ENGINEER PREDICT THE OVERALL RISK USING MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHM CALLED AS "LOGISTIC REGRESSION" 

TASK:

▶IMPORT THE LIBRARIES WHICH IS REQUIRED FOR PREDICTION.

▶IMPORT THE DATASETS USING YOUR WORKSPACE.
[EX:Google Colab,Jupiter Notebook]

▶USE THE APPROPRIATE ARGUMENT OF 'sklearn' LIBRARY TO 'train,test and split' THE DATASETS.

▶FIT YOUR VALUES WITH ARRANGE FUNCTION USING 'FEATURE SCALING'.

▶CHECK YOUR MODEL ACCURACY AND PRECISION USING 'CONFUSION MATRIX'.
